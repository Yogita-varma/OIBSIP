Project 3: Weather Information System

Description:
The Weather Information System is a Python-based application that fetches and displays real-time weather information for a given city or ZIP code. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve accurate weather data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

Note: In this API key is commitment because of github policy so if you run, you have to uncommit this.

The user can choose the temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit), and the application presents the results in a clean.
